# Vaccine-Sentiment-Classifier

The purpose of this project is to do a sentiment analysis on tweets about covid19 vaccinations in 3 classes (0-neutral, 1-negative, 2-positive). Todo this, i experimented with 4 different types of models:

Softmax Regression
Feed-Forward neural network.
Bidirectional RNN neural network with LSTM & GRU cells (witout and with attention layer).
BERT-Base-uncased.
During the development of my models, i experimented with lots of different hyperparameters (as you can see in the notebooks) and rnn cells in the 3rd type.
